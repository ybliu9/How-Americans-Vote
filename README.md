### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by [Yibai liu]

+ Project summary: [This report analyzed ANES pilot study datasets of 2019 and 2020 and explored possible explanations on Donald Trump's loss of his bid for re-election in the 2020 US Presidential Election. It was noticeable that the vast majority of Trump’s supporters were satisfied with Trump’s work and were likely going to vote for him again in 2020. In spite of disputes, Trump enjoyed strong support from people who voted for him, however, he seemed have lost some votes from previous supporters. Also, as the Covid-19 pandemic raised more concerns among the public, it made Trump’s tenure even harder, as more supporters disapproved him and turned their back on him. These are all possible explanations on why Trump was defeated by Biden in the 2020 Presidential Election.]
